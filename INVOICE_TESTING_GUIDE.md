# Invoice Use Case Testing Guide

This guide will walk you through testing all invoice workflow functionalities manually, step by step.

## Prerequisites

1. **Start the application and dependencies:**

   ```bash
   # Start PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ, and the application
   docker-compose up -d

   # Or start in development mode
   ./start-dev.sh
   ```

2. **Verify services are running:**
   - PostgreSQL: `localhost:55000`
   - RabbitMQ Management UI: `http://localhost:15672` (guest/guest)
   - Application API: `http://localhost:3030`

## Quick Start with Database Seeding

### Option 1: Automated Testing Script (Recommended)

Use the comprehensive testing script that includes database seeding:

```bash
# Make the script executable (if not already done)
chmod +x test-invoice-workflow-with-seeding.sh

# Run the complete testing suite
./test-invoice-workflow-with-seeding.sh
```

This script will:

- ‚úÖ Seed the database with test data
- ‚úÖ Test all invoice workflow scenarios
- ‚úÖ Verify error handling
- ‚úÖ Check database state
- ‚úÖ Provide cleanup options

### Option 2: Manual Database Seeding

If you prefer manual control, you can seed the database using the API:

```bash
# Seed the database with initial test data
curl -X POST http://localhost:3030/api/seeder/seed

# Verify seeding worked
curl http://localhost:3030/api/tasks

# Clear the database if needed
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3030/api/seeder/clear

# Reset the database (clear + seed)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3030/api/seeder/reset
```

### Option 3: Auto-Seeding on Startup

You can enable automatic database seeding on application startup by setting an environment variable:

```bash
# Add to your .env file or docker-compose environment
AUTO_SEED_DATABASE=true
```

## Seeded Test Data

The database seeder creates the following test data:

### Workflows

- **Invoice Generation Workflow**: Complete workflow for customer-123
- **Scheduled Invoice Workflow**: Workflow for customer-456

### Sample Tasks

- **Completed Tasks**: Full invoice workflow for customer-123 (fetch_orders ‚Üí create_invoice ‚Üí generate_pdf ‚Üí send_email)
- **Failed Task**: Simulated failure for customer-failed
- **Pending Task**: Task waiting to be processed for customer-pending

### Task Logs

- Log entries for all tasks with appropriate log levels (INFO, ERROR)
- Timestamps matching task creation and completion

## Testing Tools

### 1. API Testing

- **Automated Script**: `test-invoice-workflow-with-seeding.sh`
- **Postman Collection**: Use the provided `Queue-Worker-POC.postman_collection.json`
- **cURL**: For command-line testing
- **Browser**: For GET requests

### 2. Monitoring Tools

- **RabbitMQ Management UI**: `http://localhost:15672`
- **PostgreSQL**: Use any PostgreSQL client (pgAdmin, DBeaver, etc.)
- **Application Logs**: Check console output for detailed logging

## Step-by-Step Testing Guide

### Phase 1: Database Seeding and Verification
