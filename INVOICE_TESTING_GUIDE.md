# Invoice Use Case Testing Guide

This guide will walk you through testing all invoice workflow functionalities manually, step by step.

## Prerequisites

1. **Start the application and dependencies:**

   ```bash
   # Start PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ, and the application
   docker-compose up -d

   # Or start in development mode
   ./start-dev.sh
   ```

2. **Verify services are running:**
   - PostgreSQL: `localhost:55000`
   - RabbitMQ Management UI: `http://localhost:15672` (guest/guest)
   - Application API: `http://localhost:3030`

## Testing Tools

### 1. API Testing

- **Postman Collection**: Use the provided `Queue-Worker-POC.postman_collection.json`
- **cURL**: For command-line testing
- **Browser**: For GET requests

### 2. Monitoring Tools

- **RabbitMQ Management UI**: `http://localhost:15672`
- **PostgreSQL**: Use any PostgreSQL client (pgAdmin, DBeaver, etc.)
- **Application Logs**: Check console output for detailed logging

## Step-by-Step Testing Guide

### Phase 1: Basic Health Check

#### 1.1 Verify Application Health

```bash
curl http://localhost:3030/api/health
```

**Expected Response:**

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:00:00.000Z"
}
```

#### 1.2 Check Queue Status

```bash
curl http://localhost:3030/api/queue/status
```

**Expected Response:**

```json
{
  "pending": 0,
  "processing": 0,
  "completed": 0,
  "failed": 0,
  "total": 0,
  "isHealthy": true
}
```

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3030/api/invoice/workflow/start \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "customerId": "customer-123",
    "dateFrom": "2024-01-01",
    "dateTo": "2024-01-31",
    "workflowId": "workflow-123"
  }'
```

**Expected Response:**

```json
{
  "message": "Invoice workflow started",
  "taskId": "uuid-here",
  "workflowId": "workflow-123"
}
```

**What to Check:**

1. **Application Logs**: Look for logs starting with `üöÄ [START_INVOICE_WORKFLOW]`
2. **Database**: Check `tasks` table for new FETCH_ORDERS task
3. **RabbitMQ**: Check queue for new message

#### 2.2 Monitor Task Processing

**Check Database:**

```sql
-- Connect to PostgreSQL (localhost:55000, user: postgres, password: postgrespw, db: queue_worker)
SELECT id, type, status, payload, created_at, updated_at
FROM tasks
WHERE payload->>'customerId' = 'customer-123'
ORDER BY created_at;
```

**Check RabbitMQ:**

1. Go to `http://localhost:15672`
2. Login with `guest/guest`
3. Check the `worker_queue` for messages
4. Monitor message consumption

**Check Application Logs:**
Look for worker processing logs:

- `üîÑ [FETCH_ORDERS_COMPLETION]` - When fetch orders completes
- `üîÑ [CREATE_INVOICE_COMPLETION]` - When invoice creation completes
- `üîÑ [GENERATE_PDF_COMPLETION]` - When PDF generation completes
- `üîÑ [SEND_EMAIL_COMPLETION]` - When email sending completes

#### 2.3 Check Workflow Status

```bash
curl http://localhost:3030/api/invoice/status/customer-123
```

## Conclusion

This testing guide covers all major aspects of the invoice workflow system. By following these steps, you can:

1. Verify all functionality works correctly
2. Understand the system's behavior under different conditions
3. Debug issues effectively
4. Monitor system performance
5. Ensure data consistency

Remember to check the application logs, database, and RabbitMQ management UI throughout the testing process to get a complete picture of the system's operation.
